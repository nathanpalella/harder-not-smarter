## Nomenclature
% To better define the parameters of the program, the nomenclature for each process should be clearly
% defined, which means that there will be an ultimate level of clarity in regards to actions and operations
% within a production cell (meaning that the minutia of "operator sets parts on table" or 
% "operator adjusts part on press" will be replaced with a more universally useable set of actions).
 
% (all include start and end times if not shown)
 
## Operator actions:
% Cut blank
% Walk
% Wait
% Handling (includes machine placement, weighing, etc. other than inspection)
% Deflashing/removing
% Inspecting/storing
% Special (should be defined per case, e.g. labeling, manual hole punching)

## Machine actions:
% Start, end
% Wait (machine is finished but is waiting for parts to be removed)

## Machine types
% Presser
% Heater
% Cutter
% Welder
% Gluer
% Puncher
% Special (defined per case)

% Each machine type will receive a number if there are more than 1 of that type per cell
% e.g. "Press_1", "Press_2", otherwise "Press" will do
